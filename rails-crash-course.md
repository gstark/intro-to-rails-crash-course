## Dynamic Data on the Web

![fit](sql-right-in-html.jpg)

# Dynamic Data on the Web

```xml
<cfoutput>
  <cfquery name="myQuery" datasource="#myDatabase#">
    SELECT name, balance FROM accounts where status = 'active'
  </cfquery>
  <cfloop query="myQuery">
    #name# - #balance# <br/>
  </cfloop>
</cfoutput>
```

---

# ActiveRecord

- Based on the ‚ÄúActive Record‚Äù pattern
- Defines objects around database records
- Defines query interfaces
- Defines relationships between objects (tables)

---

# ActiveRecord

- Typically to map table to object
- Determines attributes by reflection
- Base class exposes creating, find, update, delete API

---

# ActiveRecord

```ruby
class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :transfers
  belongs_to :customer

  scope :active -> { where(status: "active") }

  def available_to_withdraw
    balance - pending
  end
end
```

---

# Database Migrations


---

![fit](migrations.mp4)

---

```ruby
class CreateBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :books do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :author_name
      t.datetime :date_published

      t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
```

# Testing

- Built into framework, generates test files for generated models, controllers.
- Can generate tests for:
  - Models
  - Controllers
  - Integration
  - e-mail

# [fit] Let's make an app

---

# But first...

- Installing Rails isn't as easy as it should be
- especially on Windows ‚Ä¶ _(Rails Installer)_
- Others:
  - ruby-install
  - rvm
  - homebrew (mac)
  - third party repo with an up-to-date ruby (2.2 or later)
- Fortunately, we can use a cloud based environment for this course

---

# Cloud 9
